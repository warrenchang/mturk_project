Introduction: Part 2
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}

<p>
    This is the start of Part 2 of the experiment.
    In this part, there will be multiple rounds of decision-making.
    You will be matched with <strong>the same participant</strong> as in Part I.
</p>
<p>
The situation in Part 2 is quite similar to Part 1. This part differs from Prat 1 only in that
